# Rethink Plaintext Editing

This is our frontend coding challenge. It gives us a chance to see your abilities and how you approach problems. It is designed to give you unlimited creative freedom as you develop a solution. Feel free to use any packages/tools/etc. you'd like to edit text as elegantly as possible. There are a variety of different file types to experiment with as you see fit.

To run the challenge:

- FORK this repo
- Download forked repo and run `npm install && npm run dev`
- Open `localhost:3000` in your browser
- Enjoy

Once complete, please email us a link to your forked repo with clean, tested code. We will use Chrome to run it.
